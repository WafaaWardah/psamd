# SQ-AST
A transformer-based speech quality prediction model. Please cite [this paper](https://www.isca-archive.org/interspeech_2025/wardah25_interspeech.html) when using this model.

## To set up

Install the dependencies (requirements.txt) and download the run_predict.py script. This is the only script needed for inference. 

### Download Weights
The weight .pth files can be downloaded from [here](https://tubcloud.tu-berlin.de/s/rik9dQaR66R8w5A). There are 5 of them for each dimension. Download and save them in the same directory as the run_predict.py script.

After the SQ-AST model was published in Interspeech 2025, the model was further trained on new datasets. This produced the improved weights that have been evaluated by it ITU-T SG12 Q9 and approved for standardization. These improved weights can be downloaded [here](https://tubcloud.tu-berlin.de/s/K9owXP3Fnj4pnJg). Note: the coloration weight file is the same, as there was no further improvement.

## Running Predictions

You can run prediction for either one .wav file or for all .wav files in a directory. You can also select if you want to only predict some dimensions to save compute time. 

### Command for inference of one .wav file

Predict all dimensions for a single .wav file and show the results on screen only (no output file will be created):

```bash
python run_predict.py --path /path/to/file.wav --print True
```

Predict selected dimensions (e.g., overall quality mos and noisiness) for a single .wav file and show the results on screen only (no output file will be created):

```bash
python run_predict.py --path /path/to/file.wav --dims mos noi --print True
```

Predict all dimensions for a single .wav file without printing the results, and save the predictions to an output file:

```bash
python run_predict.py --path /path/to/file.wav --output_dir /outputs/directory
```

### Command for inference of all wav files in a directory

Predict all dimensions for all .wav files in a directory and display the predictions on screen only (no output files will be created):

```bash
python run_predict.py --path /path/to/directory --print True
```

Predict all dimensions for all .wav files in a directory using a specified batch size and number of workers, enable GPU processing, and save the predictions to an output file without printing them on screen:

```bash
python run_predict.py \
    --path /path/to/directory \
    --output_dir /outputs/directory \
    --bs 64 \
    --nw 4 \
    --device gpu
```

### Conformance Check
The databases are the same as those used for ITU-T P.863.2 conformance testing and can be accessed [here]: (https://www.itu.int/myworkspace/t-signals/vectors?val=100015010).

### Applying the recommended wrapper for preprocessing the input signal

Use the --prep argument to preprocess the input signal(s) before running P.SAMD.

```bash
python run_predict.py \
    --path /path/to/directory \ 
    --print True \
    --prep True 
```
